Digital Dance v0.9.0

This is a fork of a much older build of SL (4.8.1 ish?)


---------------- Notable changes ----------------

- Removal of visual themes
- Removal of different game modes (ITG only)
- No more difficulty "blocks".
- Instead of blocks now there is just the numbers, but enlarged and a highlight cursor to indicate which difficulty you've selected. Both cursors are colored based on player.
- The chart pane on screen select music (the thing that lists steps, holds, etc) has the difficulty number removed. Don't need the redundancy of having the difficulty shown in 3 different ways. Also gives more space for additional info in the future.
- Density graphs always present on screen select music along with a generalized breakdown if any.
- Step artist field extended and text made slightly smaller to fit more information before it gets squished into oblivion.
- Difficulties are colored by their actual difficulty :O wow
- CDTitle support added (I think I have it so most sizes will work ?)
- Massive removal of bloat from the theme bringing it down from ~120mbs to just shy of 40mbs (over half of that is the background video on select music LOL)
- Preview music no longer loops.
- Song title present at the bottom of the mod menu.
- Style indicator at the top right on evaluation (to distinguish between single and double)
- Reverse puts the targets at the bottom of the screen to give reverse players the same amount of ~screen real esate~ as non-reverse players.


---------------- 16:9 specific changes ----------------
- Player stats added that include things like steps per set/lifetime, songs in set/lifetime, average bpm, average difficulty.
- Each player can have their own unique profile picture and if one isn't present then a default image will appear in place.
- Each player gets their own difficulty selection instead of being shared.
- Music wheel is centered and each player's assests are on their own side instead of arbitrarily having P2 cover up the wheel when playing.


---------------- How to use a profile picture ----------------
- Add a new image at the root of your save folder of your profile. 
(Example: \Save\LocalProfiles\00000000\Profile Picture.png)

The image must:
- be in png format
- have a resolution of 96x96
- be titled "Profile Picture"

---------------- KNOWN ISSUES and general things to note ----------------

- Theme is intended for home use only.
- Theme will not work without a profile.
- I have no idea if this still works properly outside of event mode? (it might? idk lol)
- With the player stats if a 2nd person wants to join in the middle of the set their steps per set will match their total steps and I have not found out a way to fix this as of yet. Otherwise everything works as intended.
- Scrolling to a marathon on screen select music will cause some lag while it tries to draw the density graph.



---------------- TO DO ----------------
- Change average bpm in player stats to be based of the Peak Notes Per Second rather than the song's bpm.
- Make the density graph load in chunks so that when loading a marathon you're not stuck waiting for the entire thing to load preventing you from scrolling.
- Add back in the pacemaker goal. (there was some issues early on that made me remove it and then it got added back, but forgot to add that part too lol)
- Maybe add more player stats (highest difficulty passed?)
- I really want to add a chart preview, but I don't know how realistic it is to do that theme-side and not be a laggy mess.
- Remake screen select music through lua to add custom sort/subsort and filter options... and also not be a laggy mess...
- Clean up my code. (it's very messy and unoptimized atm x___x) At least most things are labeled lol
